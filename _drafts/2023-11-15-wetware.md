We tend to think of biological intelligence as arising from animal nervous systems and brains. But consider this. The bacterium _E Coli_ pictured above is about 0.5 micron across. Thousands could sit in the the cross-section of a human hair. 0.5 micron is about the same size as a single synapse connecting neurons in the brain. Yet the E.Coli can process information, exhibits short-term memory and makes decisions. It has to do so, as does every organism, in order to survive.

This blog post heavily draws on, and is inspired by, Dennis Bray's remarkable 2009 book _Wetware_ [1]. This book explains the information processes which are the basis for life on Earth. The vast majority of organisms do not have nervous systems or brains, and yet they able to exhibit biological 'intelligence'. The question I ask is: what lessons might there be here for Artificial Intelligence?

**1. Clever cells**


p. 6 E.coli independent motion using heli flagellae rotating at ~ 100 Hz; decision making in order to follow chemical gradients in the fluid.

p.7 Subject to Brownian motion so needs to update environmental awareness frequently - exhibits short-term memory  

Recognises ~ 50 different chemicals, can detect less than 1 part in 10^7

p.10 Protozoa e.g. paramecium, amoeba etc - singled celled eukaryotes - 1-2 orders of magnitude larger than bacteria. Exhibit more sophisticated behaviour: e.g. amoeba's predatory behaviour, pursuing and ingesting prey.

p.12 Adapts its behaviour/mode of locomotion according to type of food
e.g. detection at a distance and pursuit of paramecium; bending and scrunching of algal filaments for easier ingestion

p.14 distinct states of activity: feeding, travelling, resting, dividing etc

p.16 Stentor exhibits rudimentary learning in response to stimuli (as opposed to hard-wired circuitry)

p.18 These organisms respond to chemical gradients, mechanical vibrations, light, gravity. I.e. they exhibit sensory inputs and _attention_. 

p.25 These creatures are 'complete functional systems', responding to same range of sensory inputs as us, to make decisions on appropriate motor outputs. But without any nervous system.

Temperature sensitive along with other senses. But note responses to temperature is different depending on availability of food and level of competition.

p.105 remarks about the observed individuality of each bacterium! Note that this should not be surprising as we've seen it in a much simpler context (zombie bots and neural bots).

p.106 good quote:
"This biological individuality. ... each cell displayed a distinct pattern of swimming."

Conclusion to part I: 

We could say that biological intelligence predated the evolution of nerve cells, nervous systems and brains by about 3 billion years. So these multicellular systems are clearly not fundamental to biological intelligence. Understanding what is might shed a useful light on artificial intelligence.


**BLOG 2: Protein circuits**

How information is processed without a nervous system.

p.55 Cellular processes dominated by thermal diffusion: Brownian motion of molecules under heat energy

Time scale for protein molecule to traverse E.coli cell ~ 10 ms i.e. 100 times/sec.
(source: http://book.bionumbers.org/what-are-the-time-scales-for-diffusion-in-cells/)

P.55-56 Cell structure (e.g. lipid membrane) maintained by strong molecular bonds - these are built by transfer of energy via ATP.

p.57 Weak bonds are easily formed and broken by molecules meeting are thermal diffusion. Weak bonds are formed by geometric 'recognition'. The strength of the bond depends on goodness of fit.
For proteins, the geometry depends on folding as a function of amino acid sequence. (Hence the strong interest in, and ML application to, predicting protein folding.)

p.60 Proteins can exist in more than one state. This can happen if a molecule has more than one binding site, A,B say.
If A is occupied B is switched on (by change of geometry - cascading through the folded molecule), if not B is switched off.

p.61 E.g. haemoglobin is such a molecular switch: it flips state when it binds to oxygen.
Control of switches can by by feedback e.g. a process that manufactures an amino acid A runs fast when A is scarce, and slows down as A becomes more abundant.

p.63 Or control may be genetic via construction of enzymes. Mechanism is the same in both cases: there is a primary 
target and a regulator.

"Two-state proteins are everywhere in a living cell ... they are the building blocks of flagella and cilia ... the molecular motors that harness chemical energy to make a cell divide, a muscle contract, an amoeba crawl ... They are at the heart of the electrical signals produced by nerve cells in our brain."

p.65 They are molecular switches - e.g. molecular transitor:
<img src="/assets/img/2023-11-15/transistor.jpg" width="100%">

p.68 "Hundreds of enzymes are linked by thermal diffusion and molecular recognition into large [PPI] networks."

p.69 Thicket of arrows representing interactions by thermal diffusion and molecular recognition - e.g. "one protein might be manufactured by one enzyme in order to regulate many others".
It's a nonlinear dynamical system that's hard to model: each chemical in the network has concentration that changes over time in response to the behaviour of its neighbours in the network.

Any organisms, to be independently mobile, must have sensory organs, internal processing of those signals, and motor outputs that determine movement. ... The organism has to perform computations.

Detection of environmental signals is performed by receptors - protein switches embedded in the external cell membrane. Cells have hundreds of different kinds of receptors.

Switching of a receptor activates it's molecular function inside the cell, initiating a chain of PPIs inside the cell. Actually it's faster and more efficient to modify the structure of target molecules - cells use enzymes to attach groups of atoms to proteins through strong bonds.

E.g. DNA codes for thousands of kinases - proteins that add a phosphate group to some target molecule - this changing its folding behaviour and activating some function of the target.

Most kinases are paired to phosphatase that efficiently removes the phosphate group from the same target.

Kinases and phosphatases work tirelessly like ants in a nest. This furnishes the cell with finely tunable devices. These are regulated by other proteins on the signal pathways.

p.79 Relevant to part III: there are many kinds of modification to protein structure, which be complex and hierarchical - "they constitute a feature unique to living systems and have no electronic equivalent."
(What's a good algorithmic model?)

Fig 4.3 enzymes as computational elements.

p.81 examples of simple tasks eg oscillators for time keeping etc

"Living organisms, by contrast [with digital computers], seem to be incorrigibly analog."
Then argues that it's less clear cut - with analog aspects of electronic computation and digital aspects in biology such as DNA base sequence, protein switches etc.

<img src="/assets/img/2023-11-15/processing.jpg" width="100%">

(This segues to an argument that NNs provide exactly a model combining digital and analog.)

p.86 relevant to part I: discussion of complex cell reactions for physical motion of cell eg amoeba. Signals have to propagate across the cell for coordinated movement with overall goal eg entrapping prey.

p.92 [In discussion of E.Coli pathways] 
Protein complexes: not all PPIs take place via diffusion - some proteins held in solid state e.g. at sensory protein complexes and at motor 'protein machines'. At sensory end this increases sensitivity and amplification of signals; at motor end enable translation to physical motion.

p 104 remarks about population of protein molecules as not at all homogeneous - more like an irregular slurry with different individuals having quite different loc environments. But still simplify in the PPI network or NN to relating the population as a single functional node 

p.120
"The biochemical pathways regulating glucose in a liver cell make up a sort of neural network."
This is complicated network with multiple inputs at each node (e.g. glucagon, insulin, adrenaline and so on).
Each node is a population of molecules of a particular protein, therefore distinct from other nodes.
Also the network is recurrent (not simply feedforward).

What is the training process? In many cases (e.g. a liver cell) the network connections (i.e. binding strengths, rates of catalysis) are learned through evolution. This is by far the most importnat training signal.
(Cf. 'Zombie bots and neural bots') 
But in some other cases (e.g. cells in the nervous systems and the immune system) there are reinforcement learning processes at work that are only partially understood.

Evolution of optimal pathways for specific biochemical scenarios demonstrated in computer simulations by Dennis Bray and collaborators.

p.125 observes that if biochemical reactions have properties of neural networks, then cells can be expected to react optimally to combinations of stimuli - which is what is observed.

p.126 Gives examples of regulator proteins that behave in typical hidden-unit fashion, taking input from many physiological indicator chemicals and outputting their signal to many targets.

p.127 cites as a benefit of this NN-like system its built-in redundancy: in most cases, if one node of the network is damaged - if the supply of one enzyme or hormone is defective - the system as a whole degrades gracefully rather than catastrophically.



**BLOG 3: Lessons for AI**

Chap 9: 'cells together'
Chemical signals in communities of bacteria. E.g. bioluminescent behaviours, quorum sensing, recognition of foreigners.
These signals can lead to collective behaviour reminiscent of higher organisms. This led to symbiotes (e.g. mitochondria, chloroplasts) and the evolution of multicellular organisms. 

p.170 The biochemical signal pathways in a single cell now extend across the cell membrane and to receptors in other cells.

Some points to note:

- animal nervous system represents a scaling up of molecular NNs. But each neuron contains the same molecular NN capability as the E Coli. So how does this shape info proc of a brain beyond the NN model?

- plants and fungi also process information and like animals have evolutionary root in molecular NNs. This suggests their info proc system might be formally described in NN terms - is that the case?

- if NNs are ubiquitous in biological info proc then they have a universality which suggests NN-based AGI could be very likely.

"Protein-protein interactions are critical steps in many signalling pathways, including those involved in immune cell activation and hormone response."
https://eandt.theiet.org/content/articles/2021/07/engineers-create-protein-circuits-which-respond-in-seconds/


The idea that the biological system for AI to emulate is the human brain feels very 1950s! - which is appropriate since that is when AI research was born. But in the 21st century we can see that this is too naive, and perhaps a better system - or at least more realistic in terms of emulating actual physical processes - is that of protein circuits and cellular information processing.

Main conclusions for AI: ANN-based AGI may soon be a reality processing/deploying multimedia content, writing/deploying code to the cloud BUT

- despite the terminology, it's incorrect to think of ANNs as simulating biological nervous systems
- it would be more accurate to think of ANN-based AGI as akin to a 'synthetic amoeba' operating in human cyber and social networks

For cross-fertilisation of ideas, AI researchers should be more aware of synthetic biology.
