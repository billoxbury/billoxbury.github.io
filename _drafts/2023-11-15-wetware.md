**BLOG 1:Clever cells.**

Information processing in biology. Evolutionary precursors to nervous systems.

p.5 Human hair diameter ~ 100 x E.coli (2 x 0.5 microns) ==> few thousand E.coli would fit on cross-section

p. 6 E.coli independent motion using heli flagellae rotating at ~ 100 Hz; decision making in order to follow chemical gradients in the fluid.
Recognises ~ 50 different chemicals, can detect less than 1 part in 10^7

p.7 Subject to Brownian motion so needs to update environmental awareness frequently - exhibits short-term memory

p.10 Protozoa e.g. paramecium, amoeba etc - singled celled eukaryotes - 1-2 orders of magnitude larger than bacteria. Exhibit more sophisticated behaviour: e.g. amoeba's predatory behaviour, pursuing and ingesting prey.

p.12 Adapts its behaviour/mode of locomotion according to type of food
e.g. detection at a distance and pursuit of paramecium; bending and scrunching of algal filaments for easier ingestion

p.14 distinct states of activity: feeding, travelling, resting, dividing etc

p.16 Stentor exhibits rudimentary learning in response to stimuli (as opposed to hard-wired circuitry)

p.18 These organisms respond to chemical gradients, mechanical vibrations, light, gravity. I.e. they exhibit sensory inputs and _attention_. 

p.25 These creatures are 'complete functional systems', responding to same range of sensory inputs as us, to make decisions on appropriate motor outputs. But without any nervous system.

**BLOG 2: Protein circuits and neural networks.**

How information is processed without a nervous system.

p.55 Cellular processes dominated by thermal diffusion: Brownian motion of molecules under heat energy

Time scale for protein molecule to traverse E.coli cell ~ 10 ms i.e. 100 times/sec.
(source: http://book.bionumbers.org/what-are-the-time-scales-for-diffusion-in-cells/)

P.55-56 Cell structure (e.g. lipid membrane) maintained by strong molecular bonds - these are built by transfer of energy via ATP.

p.57 Weak bonds are easily formed and broken by molecules meeting are thermal diffusion. Weak bonds are formed by geometric 'recognition'. The strength of the bond depends on goodness of fit.
For proteins, the geometry depends on folding as a function of amino acid sequence. (Hence the strong interest in, and ML application to, predicting protein folding.)

p.60 Proteins can exist in more than one state. This can happen if a molecule has more than one binding site, A,B say.
If A is occupied B is switched on (by change of geometry - cascading through the folded molecule), if not B is switched off.

p.61 E.g. haemoglobin is such a molecular switch: it flips state when it binds to oxygen.
Control of switches can by by feedback e.g. a process that manufactures an amino acid A runs fast when A is scarce, and slows down as A becomes more abundant.

p.63 Or control may be genetic via construction of enzymes. Mechanism is the same in both cases: there is a primary 
target and a regulator.

"Two-state proteins are everywhere in a living cell ... they are the building blocks of flagella and cilia ... the molecular motors that harness chemical energy to make a cell divide, a muscle contract, an amoeba crawl ... They are at the heart of the electrical signals produced by nerve cells in our brain."

p.65 They are molecular switches - e.g. molecular transitor:

p.68 "Hundreds of enzymes are linked by thermal diffusion and molecular recognition into large [PPI] networks."

p.69 Thicket of arrows representing interactions by thermal diffusion and molecular recognition - e.g. "one protein might be manufactured by one enzyme in order to regulate many others".
It's a nonlinear dynamical system that's hard to model: each chemical in the network has concentration that changes over time in response to the behaviour of its neighbours in the network.

**BLOG 3: What are the lessons for AI?**

"Protein-protein interactions are critical steps in many signalling pathways, including those involved in immune cell activation and hormone response."

The idea that the biological system for AI to emulate is the human brain feels very 1950s! - which is appropriate since that is when AI research was born. But in the 21st century we can see that this is too naive, and perhaps a better system - or at least more realistic in terms of emulating actual physical processes - is that of protein circuits and cellular information processing.

Main conclusions for AI: ANN-based AGI may soon be a reality processing/deploying multimedia content, writing/deploying code to the cloud BUT

- despite the terminology, it's incorrect to think of ANNs as simulating biological nervous systems
- it would be more accurate to think of ANN-based AGI as akin to a 'synthetic amoeba' operating in human cyber and social networks

For cross-fertilisation of ideas, AI researchers should be more aware of synthetic biology.
