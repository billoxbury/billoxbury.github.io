**1. AI today**

As I write this in late 2024, the year's Nobel Prizes have been announced for <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2024/press-release/" target="_blank">Physics</a> and <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2024/press-release/" target="_blank">Chemistry</a>. They included three pioneering figures from Artificial Intelligence: Geoffey Hinton and John Hopfield for their work on neural networks – both inspired by and contributing to physics; and Demis Hassabis, CEO of Deepmind, among whose profound achievements was using deep learning to solve the problem of protein folding.

Their work, and that of a great many of their colleagues and fellow researchers, have revolutionised how we all interact with data and with the Internet, to the extent that Artificial Intelligence (AI) is now a recognisable of all our lives. It has created capabilities that were previously confined to human cognition, such as interpretation (and creation) of images and language; as well as scientific applications that are well beyond human cognition:

**3. What can possibly go wrong?**
